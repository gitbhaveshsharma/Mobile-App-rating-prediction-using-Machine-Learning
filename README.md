# App Rating Prediction :rocket:

Welcome to the Mobile App Rating Prediction project! This project aims to build machine learning models to predict the rating of an app based on its features.

## Project Overview :memo:

This project utilizes a dataset containing information about various apps available on the Google Play Store. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the rating of an app using its features.

## Dataset :bar_chart:

The dataset used in this project is the "googleplaystore.csv" file. It contains the following columns:

- `App`: Name of the app
- `Category`: Category of the app
- `Rating`: Rating of the app (target variable)
- `Reviews`: Number of user reviews
- `Size`: Size of the app
- `Installs`: Number of app installs
- `Type`: Paid or free app
- `Price`: Price of the app
- `Content Rating`: Content rating of the app
- `Genres`: Genres of the app
- `Last Updated`: Last update date of the app
- `Current Ver`: Current version of the app
- `Android Ver`: Minimum Android version required by the app

## Project Workflow :gear:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical representations
   - Convert string-based numerical features to appropriate formats

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Extract meaningful features from the available data
   - Create additional features based on domain knowledge or insights from the dataset

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Train machine learning models using algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost
   - Evaluate model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

4. Predictions:
   - Use the trained models to make predictions on new data or the test set

## Model Performance :chart_with_upwards_trend:

The models' performance on the test set is as follows:

- Random Forest: RMSE = 0.489
- XGBoost: RMSE = 0.488

# Feature Selection Techniques in Machine Learning

Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning that involves identifying the most relevant and informative features from a dataset to build accurate and efficient models. This process helps reduce complexity, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. Here, we will explore some popular feature selection techniques and explain them to our hypothetical student. üßë‚Äçüéì

## Univariate Selection ‚úÖ

Univariate selection is a simple and efficient technique that evaluates each feature independently. It measures the statistical relationship between each feature and the target variable. Features with the highest scores are selected. One commonly used metric for univariate selection is the chi-square test for categorical features and the ANOVA F-value for numerical features. üìä

For example, let's consider a dataset of students' performance with features like hours studied, attendance, and previous scores. By applying univariate selection, we can identify the most influential feature for predicting the final grade.

## Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) üîÅ

RFE is an iterative technique that starts with all features and progressively eliminates the least important ones. It works by training the model with the full feature set, ranking the features by importance, and removing the least important feature. This process continues until a desired number of features is reached. üîÑ

For instance, if we have a dataset of customer data with features like age, income, purchase history, and social media engagement, RFE can help us identify the most significant features for predicting customer churn.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA) üìà

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a large set of variables into a same set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. It captures the maximum amount of information in the dataset with the fewest number of components. These components are ordered by their importance, allowing us to select the top ones. üìâ

For example, let's say we have a dataset of images with numerous pixel values as features. PCA can help us reduce the dimensionality while retaining the most relevant information, making it easier to classify images into different categories.

## Feature Importance ‚≠êÔ∏è

Feature importance techniques assign scores to each feature based on their contribution to the predictive performance of a model. This can be achieved using ensemble models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which inherently provide feature importance measures. Features with higher importance scores are considered more influential and can be selected. üåü

For example, if we are working on a dataset to predict house prices and using a Random Forest model, we can extract the feature importance scores and select the top features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

These feature selection techniques offer valuable insights for identifying the most informative features and improving model performance. By applying these methods appropriately, we can enhance our understanding of the data and build better machine learning models. üöÄ
